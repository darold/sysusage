SysUsage v5.7 - System Monitoring Tool

REQUIREMENT
  rrdtool
    You need to install rrdtool. All distribution may have a dedicated
    package for rrdtool. On CentOs/RedHat distributions, use the following
    command:

            yum install rrdtool rrdtool-perl

    on Debian/Ubuntu distributions use command:

            apt-get install rrdtool librrds-perl

    The sources can be found here:

            http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/

    If you compile from sources and want to use the RRDs perl module
    embedded with it, you must use the following command to compile:

            make site-perl-install

    This installation is optional if sysusage is installed on a remote host.

  sysstat
    You also need sar to collect statistics. Sar is part of the sysstat
    package. For RPM like distributions:

            yum install sysstat

    and Debian like distributions:

            apt-get install sysstat

    The sources can always be found here :

            http://freshmeat.net/projects/sysstat/

    If you plan to use threshold notification you must have Net::SMTP
    installed.

            yum install perl-Net-SMTP-SSL

    or

            apt-get install libnet-smtp-ssl-perl

    Sources can be found on CPAN (https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::SMTP)

  Perl modules
    Sysusage can be run in a central place to collect remote sysusage
    statistics using ssh. The remote calls are proceed simultaneously using
    fork with the Proc::Queue Perl module.

    If you're plan tu use sysusagegraph instead of sysusagejqgrpah you will
    also need the GD and GD::Graph3D Perl modules. Note that the use of GD
    and GD::Graph is deprecated and sysusagegraph will be removed in next
    major release (6.0).

    All these modules are always available from CPAN (https://metacpan.org/)
    and may at least be installed on the central server. On remote host this
    is optional and depend if you want to run it on each server or by ssh
    from a central place.

  Nagios nsca client (optional)
    If you want to send message to Nagios you need to install
    nsca-2.7.2.tar.gz or a more recent version. You can get it here:

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagios/files/

  hddtemp and sensors (optional)
    If you want to monitor your hard drive temperature you must install a
    small utility called hddtemp. You can download it from
    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/hddtemp/. Run it to see if
    your hard drive have a temperature sensor.

    You can also use sensors to monitor your cpu temperature and fan speed.
    If you harware support it run sensors-detect and load the required
    kernel modules at boot time.

INSTALLATION
  Quick install
    Simply run the following commands:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make && make install

    By default it will copy the perl programs into /usr/local/sysusage/bin
    and the HTML output will be done to /var/www/htdocs/sysusage/. The
    configuration file is /usr/local/sysusage/etc/sysusage.cfg and all RRD
    Bekerley DB databases from rrdtool will be saved under
    /usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles.

    If you plan to run sysusage on different servers from a central place
    you may just want to install the rsysusage Perl script on remote hosts.
    So proceed as follow:

            perl Makefile.PL REMOTE=1
            make && make install

    It will copy the only the rsysusage into /usr/local/sysusage/bin and the
    configuration file under /usr/local/sysusage/etc/sysusage.cfg. The RRD
    data directory will be created under /usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles but
    just to hold the *.cnt files relatives to the count of alert attempt on
    threshold exceed.

  Custom install
    You can overwrite all install path with the following Makefile.PL
    arguments. Here are the default values:

            BINDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/bin
            CONFDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/etc
            PIDDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/etc
            BASEDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles
            PLUGINDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/plugins
            HTMLDIR=/var/www/htdocs/sysusage
            MANDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/doc
            DOCDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/doc
            REMOTE=

    For example on a RedHat System you may prefer install SysUsage as this:

            perl Makefile.PL BINDIR=/usr/bin CONFDIR=/etc PIDDIR=/var/run \
                    BASEDIR=/var/lib/sysusage HTMLDIR=/var/www/html/sysusage \
                    MANDIR=/usr/man/man1 DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/sysusage

    If you are installing sysusage on a host that will be call by ssh from a
    central place, you may want to install just what is necessary and not
    more:

            perl Makefile.PL BINDIR=/usr/bin CONFDIR=/etc PIDDIR=/var/run \
                    MANDIR=/usr/man/man1 DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/sysusage \
                    REMOTE=1

    This will just install the rsysusage Perl script, the configuration file
    and documentation. So that you don't need to install extra Perl modules
    and other graphics related things.

  Package/binary install
    In directory packaging/ you will find all scripts to build RPM,
    slackBuild and debian package. See README in this directory to know how
    to build these packages.

USAGE
    SysUsage consist in two main Perl scripts, sysusage and sysusagegraph.
    Once you have correctly installed and configured SysUsage the best way
    to execute them is by setting a cron job. If you prefer javascript
    graphics instead of GD::Graph images use sysusagejqgraph that is based
    on jqplot javascript library. This is the recommanded script as use of
    GD::Graph through sysusagegraph is deprecated.

  sysusage
    The script sysusage is responsible of collecting system informations at
    a given interval and store them into rrdtool database files.

    As it is very fast you can set running interval time to 1 minute. This
    is the default pooling interval used in configuration and graph reports.
    If you change this interval you must also change it in the configuration
    file otherwise your graph will be false. See the INTERVAL configuration
    directive.

    Here is how I use it with a default installation:

            */1 * * * * /usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusage > /dev/null 2>&1

  rsysusage
    This script do the same things as the sysusage Perl script but instead
    of storing collected datas on file it will dump them to the standard
    output. This script is used instead of the sysusage Perl script by a ssh
    call from a central server where the local sysusage will store the
    statistics retrieved from multiple servers.

            /usr/local/sysusage/bin/rsysusage -r remote_hostname

    Where 'remote_hostname' is the hostname given in the [REMOTE ...]
    configuration section.

  sysusagegraph (deprecated) / sysusagejqgraph
    The perl script sysusagegraph is used to draw PNG graphs and write HTML
    file. As he knows the pooling interval given in the configuration file
    it can be run at any time. I used to run it each five minutes but you
    can run it each hours or more this is the same.

            */5 * * * * /usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusagegraph > /dev/null 2>&1

    Since release v4.0 of SysUsage there's a JQuery plotting replacement of
    rrdGraph that only write HTML files with all javascript code to allow
    the client browser to draw the graphs. To enable this feature you just
    have to use sysusagejqgrpah instead.

            */5 * * * * /usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusagejqgraph > /dev/null 2>&1

    There's some more resources javascript libraries and CSS files to
    install. The SysUsage installer will do the job for you. This remove the
    requirement of the GD, GD::Graph and GD::Graph3D Perl modules.

See README file for more information on configuration and others.

Enjoy,
