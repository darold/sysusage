SysUsage v5.2 - System Monitoring Tool

REQUIREMENT

  rrdtool
    You need to install rrdtool. You can find it at:

            http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/

    To use the RRDs perl module you must use the following command to
    compile the distrib:

            make site-perl-install

    This installation is optional if sysusage is installed on a remote host.

  sysstat
    You also need sar to collect statistics. Sar is part of the sysstat
    package. You can find it here :

            http://freshmeat.net/projects/sysstat/

    If you plan to use threshold notification you must have Net::SMTP
    installed. It can be found on CPAN (http://search.cpan.org)

  Perl modules
    Since release 5.0 sysusage can be run in a central place to collect remote
    sysusage statistics using ssh. The remote calls are proceed simultaneously
    using fork and the Proc::Queue Perl module.

    If you're plan tu use sysusagegraph instead of sysusagejqgrpah you will also
    need the GD and GD::Graph3D Perl modules.

    All these modules are always available from CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/)
    and may at least be installed on the central server. On remote host this is
    optional and depend if you want to run it on each server or by ssh from a
    central place.

  Nagios nsca client (optional)
    If you want to send message to Nagios you need to install
    nsca-2.7.2.tar.gz or a more recent version. You can get it here:

            http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagios/files/

  hddtemp and sensors (optional)
    If you want to monitor your hard drive temperature you must install a
    small utility called hddtemp. You can download it from
    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/hddtemp/. Run it to see if
    your hard drive have a temperature sensor.

    You can also use sensors to monitor your cpu temperature and fan speed.
    If you harware support it run sensors-detect and load the required
    kernel modules at boot time.

INSTALLATION

  Quick install
    Simply run the following commands:

            perl Makefile.PL
            make && make install

    By default it will copy the perl programs into /usr/local/sysusage/bin
    and the HTML output will be done to /var/www/htdocs/sysusage/. The
    configuration file is /usr/local/sysusage/etc/sysusage.cfg and all RRD
    Bekerley DB databases from rrdtool will be saved under
    /usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles.

    If you plan to run sysusage on different servers from a cntral place you
    may just want to install the rsysusage Perl script on remote hosts. So
    proceed as follow:

            perl Makefile.PL REMOTE=1
            make && make install

    It will copy the only the rsysusage into /usr/local/sysusage/bin and
    the configuration file under /usr/local/sysusage/etc/sysusage.cfg. The
    RRD data directory will be created under /usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles
    but just to hold the *.cnt files relatives to the count of alert attempt
    on threshold exceed.

  Custom install
    You can overwrite all install path with the following Makefile.PL
    arguments. Here are the default values:

            BINDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/bin
            CONFDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/etc
            PIDDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/etc
            BASEDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/rrdfiles
            PLUGINDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/plugins
            HTMLDIR=/var/www/htdocs/sysusage
	    MANDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/doc
	    DOCDIR=/usr/local/sysusage/doc
	    REMOTE=

    For example on a RedHat System you may prefer install SysUsage as this:

            perl Makefile.PL BINDIR=/usr/bin CONFDIR=/etc PIDDIR=/var/run \
                    BASEDIR=/var/lib/sysusage HTMLDIR=/var/www/html/sysusage

    If you are installing sysusage on a host that will be call by ssh from a
    central place, you may want to install just what is necessary and not more:

        perl Makefile.PL BINDIR=/usr/bin CONFDIR=/etc PIDDIR=/var/run \
                MANDIR=/usr/man/man1 DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/sysusage \
                REMOTE=1

    This will just install the rsysusage Perl script, the configuration file and
    all documentation. So that you don't need to install extra Perl modules and
    other graphics related things.

  Package/binary install
    In directory packaging/ you will find all scripts to build RPM, slackBuild
    and debian package. See README in this directory to know how to build these
    packages.

  Previous version
    Previous version used to ask a lot of questions during install, this was
    removed since version 3.0 to the benefice of simplicity and a default
    configuration file.

USAGE
    SysUsage consist in two perl scripts, sysusage and sysusagegraph. Once
    you have correctly installed and configured SysUsage the best way to
    execute them is by cron job.

  sysusage
    The script sysusage is responsible of collecting system informations at
    a given interval and store them into rrdtool database files.

    As it is very fast you can set running interval time to 1 minute. This
    is the default pooling interval used in configuration and graph reports.
    If you change this interval you must also change it in the configuration
    file otherwise your graph will be false. See the INTERVAL configuration
    directive.

    Here is how I use it with a default installation:

            */1 * * * * /usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusage > /dev/null 2>&1

  sysusagegraph or sysusagejqgraph
    The perl script sysusagegraph is used to draw PNG graphs and write HTML
    file. As he knows the pooling interval given in the configuration file
    it can be run at any time. I used to run it each five minutes but you
    can run it each hours or more this is the same.

            */5 * * * * /usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusagegraph > /dev/null 2>&1

    If you want to use the jqplot javascript library instead of rrdGraph, just
    call the dedicated perl script:

            */5 * * * * /usr/local/sysusage/bin/sysusagejqgraph > /dev/null 2>&1

See README file for more information on configuration and others.

Enjoy,
