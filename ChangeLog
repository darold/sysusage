2012-03-11: v5.2

	- Add current/max/average values on jqplot graphs legend. Thanks to
	  Josian Larcheveque and Steve Bremer for the feature request.
	- The jqplot graph legends has move to the bottom of the graph.
	- Fix detection of an already running sysusagejqgraph instance.
	- Update online documentation to add missing information on cpuall.
	- Update packaging files version.

UPGRADE: only the perl scripts in the bin/ directory have changed so you can
just overide your current files.

2012-03-03: v5.1

	- Fix wrong information on hostname, uptime and sysstat version of a
	  remote server. Thanks to Josian Larcheveque for the patch.
	- Fix missing process name on thread and process reports on remote
	  host. Thanks to Josian Larcheveque for the patch. 
	- Add 'cpuall' target to only report global statistics on all CPUs. Use
	  it if you have lot of CPUs. Thanks to Pavel Niederle for the feature
	  request.
	- Fix an issue in reporting null data from plugins.
	- Add missing alarm notification on plugin threshold exceed. Thanks to
	  Pavel Niederle for the report.
	- Fix missing information into kernel.txt data file for remote hosts.
	- Fix uptime and kernel version report of a remote host.

UPGRADE: only the perl scripts in the bin/ directory have changed. If you want
to replace cpu target by cpuall in your configuration file to only report global
CPU usage, you may want to remove all cpuN and cpudistN data file in the data
repository (just keep files cpu and cpudist, others cpu files with a number can
be removed).

2011-11-24: v5.0

This is a new major version that allow SysUsage to be run in a central place to
collect and graph statistics from multiple remote servers. An other new feature
is the possibility to delay alarm after a given number of attempts.

	- Modify CSS sysusage.css to absolute position instead of relative to
	  fix a display problem on desktop/browser with resolution < 1024.
	  Thanks to Paul Rubin for the patch.
	- Fix positioning of copyright in start page.
	- Change HTML output default install directory to be /var/www/sysusage
	  instead of /var/www/htdocs/sysusage or /var/www/html/sysusage if the
	  htdocs directory doesn't exists.
	- Fix padding between logo and first tab in jqplot output.
	- Remove support to sysstat version < 5.1.3 that do not have support for
	  -p option and migrate the code to get sysstat version from sysusage
	  into Sar.pm
	- Add attempt counter to delay threshold min or max exceed before
	  calling the alarm script. You can specify an attempt number per
	  monitored target by adding an attempt count between brackets after
	  the max and/or min threshold. For example:

		load:8(4):
		proc:httpd:25(3):0(2)

	  this will call the alarm program if the load average is upper than 8
	  after 4 consecutive sysusage run interval. The second will warn if
	  the number of httpd process is upper than 25 after 3 successive run
	  or two successive run if no httpd process is running. The last can
	  be useful if sysusage run just when httpd is restarted. Thanks to
	  Paul Rubin for the feature request.
	- Nagios OK message is now sent after lower threshold alarm recovery.
	- The old sysusage.cfg file is no more renamed into sysusage.cfg.old
	  after an upgrade install, but instead the new one is created as
	  sysusage.cfg.new

	- Use Proc::Queue to limit child process queue size, this Perl module
	  is now required to run sysusage.
	- Add new configuration section [REMOTE hostname] that allow sysusage to
	  be executed on a remote host. This allow to run sysusage from a central
	  server and sysusagegraph one time on this server, see documentation for
	  more information.
	- Add 'remote' configuration option to PLUGIN section to disable/enable
	  the plugin on remote host execution. Default value is 'yes', if you
	  don't want to execute the plugin on remote host set it to 'no'.
	- Allow space characters between bracket and the section's name in the
	  configuration file.
	- Allow use of ':' or '=' character for directive / value separator into
	  the GENERAL, ALARM, PLUGIN and REMOTE sections. MONITOR section still
	  only use the ':' separator.
	- Several directive have also been added to the GENERAL section:
	  PROC_QSIZE, RESRC_URL, SSH_BIN, SSH_OPTION, SSH_USER and SSH_IDENTITY.
	  See documentation.

UPGRADE: backward compatibility with previous data files have been preserved but
those files will be placed under a subdirectory per hostname. You will need to
replace all Perl scripts, javascript and css files so it should be better to
proceed to a full install. New configuration file will be copied as sysusage.cfg.new


2011-01-17: v4.0

	- Add support to jquery rendered graphs. You just have to replace
	  sysusagegraph by sysusagejqgraph on you cron command line. With this
	  graph renderer configuration options FLAMING,HIRES,LINE_SIZE are not
	  used. This feature use jqPlot a plotting and charting plugin for the
	  jQuery Javascript framework. See: http://www.jqplot.com/ for more.
	  Thanks to Chris Leonello for his great library.
	- Add missing help/info on some sar output.
	- Fix some CSS errors in sysusage.css
	- Update documentation.

UPGRADE: This release is fully compatible with 3.3 version, so if you don't want
to reinstall all using Makefile.PL you can just copy sysusagejqgraph into the
bin directory and untar resources/jqplot-sysusage.tar.gz into the HTML output
directory and replace the css files of the HTML output directory with the css
files from the resources directory.


2010-07-30: v3.3

	- Add I/O workload per device. I/O workload is the relation between TPS
	  (transfers per second) and IOPS (I/O operations measured in seconds)
	  of a device. If the tps returned by sysstat reach the max theoretical
	  IOPS, your storage subsystem is saturated. See 'dev' monitoring config
	  directive and Documentation/Configuration/Specials Cases
	- Add indication of the maximum I/O throughput of a disk, and may
	  suggest where a I/O bottleneck can occur. This is based on:
	  Maximum disk throughput (KB/s) = (rd_sec/s + wr_sec/s) * 50 / %util
	- Change sysusage graph label "Percent cached swap used" by
	  "Percent swap used by cache".
	- Alarm on high memory load is know calculated in percentage of real
	  memory used, i-e: without cache and buffer memory usage.
	- Suppress install warning on hddtemp and sensors if they not exists.
	- Allow multiple recipient to alarm report by using a coma separated
	  list of email adresses as value of the TO configuration directive.

UPGRADE: Just override bin/sysusage and bin/sysusagegraph.

2010-02-01: v3.2

	- Fix use of wrong 'work' threshold notification value, Kb instead of %.
	- Add submenu in Plugins section. See 'menu' configuration option in
	  [PLUGIN] section.
	- Add new line char after Threshold Max legend in graph.

UPGRADE: Just override bin/sysusage and bin/sysusagegraph.

2010-01-12: v3.1

	- This new release integrate the great work of Marat Dyatko on new
	  web design. I hope you will love it. Thanks a lot Marat !
	  This include Code licensed under the BSD License from Yahoo! Inc.
	  This is to have IE compatibility on CSS menu. If this brake something
	  for you, let me know.
	- Meta-tag refresh has been removed in favor of JavaScript refresh to.
	  only refresh graphs images without full page reload. That's an other
	  addon of Marat Dyatko.
	- Moved css file, Javascript, logo and extra images to resources/ dir.
	  So if you want you can customized more easily the web design.
	- Fix problem with localization. Output pf the sar, and df command are
	  now forced to default locale C. Every command is executed with the
	  environment variable LC_ALL=C.
	- Fix utf8 and russian(all?) locale, added "use open ':locale';" in
	  Sar.pm. Thanks to Ilya for the patch.
	- Fix bug in check_running() method in sysusage where it was reporting
	  a process when none confusing with sysusagegraph. Thanks to Josian
	  Larcheveque for the report.
	- Fix bug on device monitoring where values was always null if device
	  name was containing an underscore. Thanks to Josian Larcheveque for
	  the report.
	- Add missing FLAMING option in default configuration file. Disable
	  by default.
	- Add HIRES configuration directive in GENERAL section to allow fine
	  granularity of the data. Set it to any hour interval (value must be
	  an integer between 1 to 23). Disable by default. Thanks to Michael
	  Bugaev for the feature request.
	- Change process list command 'ps awx ...' by 'ps -e ...'
	- Add 'tproc' configuration directive in MONITOR section to monitor
	  number of thread instead of process (proc). Process are monitored
	  with 'ps -e' and thread with 'ps -eL'.
	- Update packaging script with new sysusage site URL.
	- Set disk usage exclusion as dynamic menu on sysusagegraph to avoid
	  displaying link to old data file.
	- Update web site to reflect changes and add a link to an html page
	  referencing sites hosting SysUsage Plugins.

UPGRADE: Just overwrite the perl Sar.pm module, perl scripts and copy CSS, JS
and images files from the resources/ directory to the HTML output dir. This
release is fully backward compatible with data files.
